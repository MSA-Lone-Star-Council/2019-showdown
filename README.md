# Showdown
The app for MSA Showdown, hosted by Lone Star Council

Welcome, developer, to the codebase for the MSA Showdown App! This app was originally created by Saad Najmi, Zuhair Parvez, and Sohail Shaikh in 2014. Since then, the app has grown a considerable amount. Also, we picked up new developers including Ali Kedwaii, Hamza Khatri, and Ali Naqvi. If you are reading this, you are probably the next in the line of succession!

# Workflow

We follow the Github Flow Workflow, which has a good explainer in the following link.

https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

Pull requests are approved by an admin, who should just be the head developer of each year's committee. Also, there can be more than one admin. Every pull request should be reviewed by at least one more person. 

Here's an example of a pull request with a LOT of comments -> https://github.com/MSA-Lone-Star-Council/Showdown/pull/54
Here's an example of a pull request with a few comments    -> https://github.com/MSA-Lone-Star-Council/Showdown/pull/48

We also make heavy use of the issue tracker. The issue tracker is useful for a few things

1) Reporting bugs encountered during dev / production / etc
2) Keeping track of new features to be added
3) Scoping your Pull Requests properly so that you only need to work on your one feature (any more related features that pop up while coding you can just make an issue, and add it to the tracker for your next pull request).

Pull requests also mention which issues they close, as can be seen here -> https://github.com/MSA-Lone-Star-Council/Showdown/pull/74
